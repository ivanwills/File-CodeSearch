=head1 NAME

File::CodeSearch - Search file contents in code repositories

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to File::CodeSearch version 0.5.9.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use File::CodeSearch;

   # Simple usage
   code_search {
       my ($file, $line) = @_;
       // do stuff
   },
   @dirs;

   # More control
   my $cs = File::CodeSearch->new();
   $cs->code_search(sub {}, @dirs);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 C<new ( %params )>

B<Parameters>:

=over 4

=item C<regex> - L<File::CodeSearch::RegexBuilder>

This is the object that handles the testing of individual lines in a file
and must be created with the search options desired, note you can also use
the C<F::C::Highlighter> and C<F::C::Replacer> modules interchangeably with
C<F::C::RegexBuilder>.

=item C<files> - L<File::CodeSearch::Files>

If you desire to limit files by file type, name, symlink status pass this
object, other wise a default object will be created.

=item C<recurse> - Bool

Set to false to not recurse into sub directories.

=item C<breadth> - Bool

Changes the search order to breadth first i.e. the searching will search all
the ordinary files in a directory before searching the directories. The
default is to search directories when they are found.

=item C<depth> - Bool

Changes the search order to depth first i.e. the searching will search all the
sub directories in a directory before searching the ordinary files. The
default is to search directories when they are found. If both C<breadth> and
C<depth> are both true C<breadth> will be used.

=item C<suround_before> - Int

Specifies the maximum number of lines before a match is found that should be
passed to the searching code reference.

=item C<suround_after> - Int

Specifies the maximum number of lines after a match is found that should be
passed to the searching code reference. B<Note> the after match lines are
passed to the next matched line in a file or to a call at the end of a file
with matches.

=item C<limit> - Int

Stops matching after C<limit> matches have been found across all files that
have been searched.

=back

B<Return>: C<File::CodeSearch> - new object

B<Description>: Creates & configure a C<File::CodeSearch> object.

=head2 C<search ( $search, @dirs )>

B<Arguments>:

=over 4

=item C<$search> - code ref

Subroutine to be executed each time a match in a file is found.

The subroutine should have accept parameters as

 $search->($line, $file, $line_number, %named);

=over 4

=item C<$line> - string

The line from the file that was matched by C<regex>. If searching with
C<after> set this may be undefined when called with the lines found after
the last match at the end of the file.

=item C<$file>

The file name that the line was found in (relative to the supplied directory

=item C<$line_number>

The line number in the said file

=item C<%named>

This contains all the other helpful values

=over 4

=item C<codesearch> - C<F::CodeSearch>

The object that is doing the searching.

=item C<before> - ArrayRef

An array of lines that were found before the matched line.

=item C<after> - ArrayRef

An array of lines that were found after the last matched line.

=item C<lines> - ArrayRef

An array of lines of the file. This is only present if C<regex> is a
C<F::C::Replacer> object.

=item C<parent> - path

The parent path from @path

=back

=back

=item C<@dir> - paths

An array of the directory paths to search through.

=back

B<Return>:

B<Description>:

=head2 C<search_file ( $search, $file, $parent )>

B<Param>:

=over 4

=item C<$search> - CodeRef

See C<search> above for details.

=item C<$file> - file

A file to search through line by line

=item C<$parent> - path

The directory from @dirs which the file was found in

=back

B<Description>: Searches an individual file for matches.
